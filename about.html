    <p class="about">The Chandrayaan programme  also known as the Indian Lunar Exploration Program is an ongoing series of outer space missions by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) for the exploration of the Moon. The program incorporates a lunar orbiter, an impactor, a soft lander and a rover spacecraft.

        There have been three missions so far with a total of two orbiters, landers and rovers each. While the two orbiters were successful, the first lander and rover which were part of the Chandrayaan-2 mission, crashed on the surface. The current Chandrayaan-3 successfully landed on the moon on 23 August 2023, making India the first nation to successfully land a spacecraft on the lunar south pole region, and only the fourth country ever to land on the moon after the defunct Soviet Union, the United States, and China.</p>
