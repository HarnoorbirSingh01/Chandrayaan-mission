    <h3>Chandrayaan-2: <span>The software glitch</span></h3>
    <p class="intro" >Chandrayaan 2 is the second lunar exploration mission developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), after Chandrayaan-1. It consists of a lunar orbiter, and formerly included the Vikram lander and the Pragyan rover, all of which were developed in India. The main scientific objective is to map and study the variations in lunar surface composition, as well as the location and abundance of lunar water. The spacecraft was launched from the second launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Andhra Pradesh on 22 July 2019 at 09:13:12 UTC by a LVM3-M1 rocket. The craft reached the lunar orbit on 20 August 2019 and began orbital positioning manoeuvres for the landing of the Vikram lander. The lander and the rover were scheduled to land on the near side of the Moon, in the south polar region at a latitude of about 70Â° south on 6 September 2019.However, the lander crashed when it deviated from its intended trajectory while attempting to land on 6 September 2019. According to a failure analysis report submitted to ISRO, the crash was caused by a software glitch.</p>

    <h4>The History</h4>
    <p class="history">
        Representatives from Roscosmos and ISRO signed a collaboration agreement on Chandrayaan-2, the follow-up mission to Chandrayaan-1, on November 12th, 2007. ISRO would be in charge of the orbiter, rover, and GSLV launch, while Roscosmos would supply the lander. On September 18, 2008, the Union Cabinet, which was presided over by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, approved the mission. The spacecraft's design was finished in August 2009 after a collaborative examination by scientists from both nations.Although ISRO finalised the payload for Chandrayaan-2 on schedule, the mission was postponed in January 2013 and rescheduled to 2016 because Russia was unable to develop the lander on time. In 2012, there was a delay in the construction of the Russian lander for Chandrayaan-2 due of the failure of the Fobos-Grunt mission to Mars, since the technical issues connected with the Fobos-Grunt mission which were also used in the lunar projects including the lander for Chandrayaan-2 needed to be reviewed. The changes proposed by Roscosmos necessitated increase in lander mass and required ISRO to decrease mass of its rover and accept some reliability risk.Russia cited its inability to provide the lander even by a revised time-frame of 2015 due to technical and financial reasons, India decided to develop the lunar mission independently. With new mission timeline for Chandrayaan-2 and an opportunity for a Mars mission arising with launch window in 2013, unused Chandrayaan-2 orbiter hardware was repurposed to be used for Mars Orbiter Mission</p>

    <h4>It's Goals</h4>
    <p class="goal" >
        1. To study lunar topography, mineralogy, elemental abundance, the lunar exosphere, and signatures of hydroxyl and water ice.
       
        <br><br>
    2. To study the water ice in the south polar region and thickness of the lunar regolith on the surface. <br><br>
3. To map the lunar surface and help to prepare 3D maps of it <br><br>
4. To demonstrate the ability to soft-land and operate a robotic rover on the lunar surface <br><br></p>
